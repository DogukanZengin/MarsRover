1- **Multiple** **rovers** are sent to Mars by NASA

2- Rovers land on a **rectangular** **plateau**

3- Rovers will get a complete view of surrounding **terrain** to send back to earth

4- A rover has a location on surface with **X** and **Y** coordinates, and facing a **direction(N,W,S,E)**

5- Plateau is divided into a **grid** with bottom left corner being 0,0 and top right corner max X,Y value

6- Rover must accept **orders** which made of a **string of letters**.

7- **L** means turn 90 degrees left, **R** means turn 90 degrees right and M means move forward one point in the facing direction(N,y+1),(S,y-1),(W, x-1),(E,x+1)

8- First line of input is max X,Y of the plateau

9- Then each line is a rover consisting the rovers initial position and move orders from nasa
